Pointy Haired Boss - A weird tool we use for time tracking and high level priority management

This is only used internally at my work at the moment. It is not fit for human consumption.

It may be useful as an example of a non-trivial snap/heist/digestive functors/esqueleto application but I'm not entirely happy with the code yet for those purposes either. ;)
